<h1><strong>Food as Fuel Before, During and After Workouts</strong></h1>
<p>Your body is your vehicle, so you have to keep your engine running when you work out. That means fueling up your body by eating the right foods and drinking the right fluids, in the right amounts at the right times.
</p>
<p>
The foods you eat don’t need to differ between the bulking and cutting phase — usually, it’s the amounts that do.</p>
<p>Foods to eat include</p>
<ul><li>Meats, poultry and fish: Sirloin steak, ground beef, pork tenderloin, venison, chicken breast, salmon, tilapia and cod.</li>
<li>Dairy: Yogurt, cottage cheese, low-fat milk and cheese.</li>
<li>Grains: Bread, cereal, crackers, oatmeal, quinoa, popcorn and rice.</li>
<li>Fruits: Oranges, apples, bananas, grapes, pears, peaches, watermelon and berries.</li>
<li>Starchy vegetables: Potatoes, corn, green peas, green lima beans and cassava.</li>
<li>Vegetables: Broccoli, spinach, leafy salad greens, tomatoes, green beans, cucumber, zucchini, asparagus, peppers and mushrooms.</li>
<li>Seeds and nuts: Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds, chia seeds and flax seeds.</li>
<li>Beans and legumes: Chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans, black beans and pinto beans.</li></ul>
</p><br>
<h2><strong>Foods to Limit</strong></h2>
<p>While you should include a variety of foods in your diet, there are some you should limit.</p>
<p>These include: </p>
<ul><li>Alcohol: Alcohol can negatively affect your ability to build muscle and lose fat, especially if you consume it in excess </li>
<li>Added sugars: These offer plenty of calories but few nutrients. Foods high in added sugars include candy, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, cake and sugar-sweetened beverages, such as soda and sports drinks</li>
<li>Deep-fried foods: These may promote inflammation and — when consumed in excess — disease. Examples include fried fish, french fries, onion rings, chicken strips and cheese curds</li></ul><br>
<p>In addition to limiting these, you may also want to avoid certain foods before going to the gym that can slow digestion and cause stomach upset during your workout.
<ul>
<li>High-fat foods: High-fat meats, buttery foods and heavy sauces or creams.</li>
<li>High-fiber foods: Beans and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower.</li>
<li>Carbonated beverages: Sparkling water or diet soda.</li></ul></p>
<br>
<h2><strong>Bodybuilding Supplements</strong></h2>
<p>The best bodybuilding supplements include:
<ul><li>Whey protein: Consuming whey protein powder is an easy and convenient way to increase your protein intake.<li>
<li>Creatine: Creatine provides your muscles with the energy needed to perform an additional rep or two. While there are many brands of creatine, look for creatine monohydrate as it’s the most effective</li>
<li>Caffeine: Caffeine decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder. It’s found in pre-workout supplements, coffee or tea </li>
<li>A multi-vitamin and mineral supplement may be helpful if you’re limiting your calorie intake in an effort to reduce body fat during your cutting phase.</li></ul></p>
<br>
